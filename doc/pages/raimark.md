> [ DANGER ]
> This is very DANGEROUS

> [DANGER]
> If you're using a notebook environment like
> **Jupyter Notebook**, **JupyterLab**,
> or **Google Colab**,
> use a **terminal** to run pip,
> not a code cell.
>
> The button to open a terminal in Jupyter Lab / Notebook looks like this:
>
> ![opening a terminal in Jupyter: file > new > terminal](../img/doc/scrot/jupy_notebook_terminal.png)
>
> Google Colab requires a paid subscription to use the terminal.
> If you don't have a paid subscription,
> just run `!pip install raimad` in a code cell and hope that it works.
> 
> _The reason running `pip` inside a code cell is a bad idea is that
> if `pip` decides to ask you an interactive question,
> the notebook will hang forever.
> This happens because code cells are not real terminals,
> even though `pip` gets tricked into thinking that they are._

> [ INFO ]
> This is very INFORMATIVE

> [ SEEALSO ]
> This is a see also block

> [ WORKINPROGRESS ]
> This is still being worked on
