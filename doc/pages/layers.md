# Layers

Components can have multiple layers.
Layers are identified by their name, which is a string.
All layer names should consist of lowercase letters, digits, and underscores.
You use the `.map()` method to map different subcomponents
to different layers.

<!-- TODO enfore layer naming in RAIMAD -->

```python exec
import raimad as rai

class Antenna(rai.Compo):
    def _make(self):
        reflector = rai.Circle(20).proxy().map('gnd')
        active = rai.CustomPoly((
            (0, 5),
            (10, -5),
            (10, 5),
            (0, -5),
            )).proxy().map('conductor')

        active.bbox.mid.to(
            reflector.bbox.mid)

        self.subcompos.reflector = reflector
        self.subcompos.active = active

antenna = Antenna()
rai.show(antenna)
```

## Layer maps

All of the [builtin components](builtin-compos.md)
have only one layer, `root`.
If your component has multiple layers,
you can pass a dict to `.map()` in order to assign each of the child
component layers to parent component layers.
For example, a component like `Antenna` may define abstract layer names
such as `gnd` and `conductor`,
while your toplevel design might define them as concrete materials,
like `al` and `nbtin`.
The keys of the dict are the child layer names,
and the values are the parent layer names.

```python exec
class MySpectrometer(rai.Compo):
    def _make(self):
        antenna = Antenna().proxy().map({
            'conductor': 'nbtin',
            'gnd': 'al',
            })

        diel_rect = antenna.subcompos.active.bbox.pad(5)

        antenna_diel = rai.RectLW(
            diel_rect.length,
            diel_rect.width,
            ).proxy().map('ox')

        antenna_diel.bbox.mid.to(
            antenna.bbox.mid)

        # Add other subcomponents...

        self.subcompos.antenna = antenna
        self.subcompos.antenna_diel = antenna_diel

spec = MySpectrometer()
rai.show(spec)
```

## Annotating layers

You should declare which layers your component will have
by creating a nested class called `Layers` within your component class.
Please include the layer's name and a brief description of what it is.
You should do this because:

- It makes your code easier for others to understand
- It sets a concrete order for the layers

```exec python hide-output
class Antenna(rai.Compo):

    class Layers:
        gnd = rai.Layer("Ground plane")
        conductor = rai.Layer("Conductor layer for antenna's active element")

    def _make(self):
        ...

class MySpectrometer(rai.Compo):

    class Layers:
        nbtin = rai.Layer(
            "Niobium-titanium-nitride layer deposited by electrobeam"
            )
        ox = rai.Layer("Dielectric silicon oxide layer")
        al = rai.Layer("Aluminium ground plane")

    def _make(self):
        ...
```

## Removing unwanted layers

You can remove unwanted layers by mapping them to `None`:

```python exec
class RemoveUnwantedLayers(rai.Compo):
    def _make(self):
        spectro = MySpectrometer().proxy().map({
            'nbtin': 'nbtin',
            'al': 'al',
            'ox': None,
            })

        self.subcompos.spectro = spectro

rai.show(RemoveUnwantedLayers())
```

<!-- FIXME None doesn't actually work!!>!?!?!?!? -->
